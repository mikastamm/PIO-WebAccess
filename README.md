# PIO-WebAccess

A simple Arduino Library for platformio for reducing boilerplate in my sketches. 

### Features
- One-line wifi setup with multiple credentials to try
- Enable OTA updates
- Register functions to be callable as commands over WebSerial (Planned: Make the registered functions also available as api endpoints)
